# SemanticSearch

ðŸ”¹Info
---
This project creates a Chrome extension, enabling users to semantically search
within a web page content. The extension uses pretrained models from <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/" target="_blank">ðŸ¤— Transformers</a> library

To build the extension use these commands:

```sh
npm install
npx webpack
```

To install the unpacked extension in chrome, follow these [instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted).  Briefly, navigate to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`, make sure that the `Developer mode` switch is turned on in the upper right, and click `Load Unpacked`.  Then select the appropriate directory (the `dist` directory containing `manifest.json`);

If everything is setup correctly you should see an icon for the `SemanticSearch` Chrome extension.
