# SemanticSearch
Chromium based extension which allows you to semmanticaly search web pages using a state of the art NLP model.
The repo contains code for both the extension, as well as the API. Becuase the model used for answer retrieval is huge (Fine-tuned [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) model)
I higlhly recommend you to use some cloud provider (GCP, AWS, etc.) to run the API on.
